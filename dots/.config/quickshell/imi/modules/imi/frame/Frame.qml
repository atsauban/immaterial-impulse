/**
 * The frame's four bands (frame mode, stage 1), one per screen edge, drawn
 * in the bar's colour so bar, bands and the ScreenCorners fillets read as
 * one connected surface. The band on the bar's edge sits under the bar
 * plate; every other edge, the dock's included, is the band alone - a
 * pinned dock meets it on its own terms (Dock.qml: on it as a tab, or a
 * gap above it). Input passes through (an empty
 * mask); nothing is reserved - the band lives in the outer gap windows
 * already leave. Painted transparent, never unmapped, for a fullscreen
 * window.
